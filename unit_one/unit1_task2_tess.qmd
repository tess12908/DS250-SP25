## QUESTION 1

<!-- Make sure at least one of your charts includes reference marks!! -->

__How does your name at your birth year compare to its use historically? Your must provide a chart. The years labels on your charts should not include a comma.__ 

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
# Q1
# Filter for the name "Tess"
tess_df = df[df['name'] == 'Tess']

# Create the plot
ax = tess_df.plot(x='year', y='Total', kind='line', label='Tess', color='green', linewidth=2, figsize=(10, 6))

# Highlight 2003 with a red dot
tess_2003 = tess_df[tess_df['year'] == 2003]
ax.scatter(tess_2003['year'], tess_2003['Total'], color='red', label='Tess in 2003', zorder=10)

# Title and labels
ax.set_title("Popularity of the Name 'Tess' Over Time", fontsize=14)
ax.set_xlabel("Year")
ax.set_ylabel("Total")

# Show legend
ax.legend()

```


## QUESTION 2

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
# Q2

brittany_df = df[df['name'] == 'Brittany']

# Create the plot
ax = brittany_df.plot(x='year', y='Total', kind='line', label='Brittany', color='blue', linewidth=2, figsize=(10, 6))

# Title and labels
ax.set_title("Popularity of the Name 'Brittany' Over Time", fontsize=14)
ax.set_xlabel("Year")
ax.set_ylabel("Total")

# Highlight 2003 with a red dot
brit_90s = brittany_df[brittany_df['year'] == 1990]
ax.scatter(brit_90s['year'], brit_90s['Total'], color='red', label='Peek of Brittany', zorder=10)

# Show legend
ax.legend()

print("I would say she is around 30 years old because brittany was most popular in the 90's ")

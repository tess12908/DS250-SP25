## QUESTION 1

<!-- Make sure at least one of your charts includes reference marks!! -->

__Mary, Martha, Peter, and Paul are all Christian names. From 1920 - 2000, compare the name usage of each of the four names in a single chart. What trends do you notice? You must provide a chart. The years labels on your charts should not include a comma.__ 

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}

# Filter for relevant names and years
christian_names_df = df[
    (df['name'].isin(['Mary', 'Martha', 'Peter', 'Paul'])) &
    (df['year'] >= 1920) & (df['year'] <= 2000)
]

# Pivot the DataFrame so each name becomes a column
pivot_df = christian_names_df.pivot(index='year', columns='name', values='Total')

# Plot using Pandas' built-in plot (no plt or loop)
pivot_df.plot(
    figsize=(10, 6),
    title='Usage of Christian Names (1920–2000)',
    linewidth=2
)

print("It looks like over the years, the christian names have become less popular")



```


## QUESTION 2

1. __Think of a unique name from a famous movie. Plot the usage of that name and see how changes line up with the movie release. Does it look like the movie had an effect on usage? You must provide a chart. The years labels on your charts should not include a comma.__  

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
# Q2

selected_names = ['Luke', 'Lea']

starwars_df = df[
    (df['name'].isin(selected_names)) & 
    (df['year'] >= 1950) & 
    (df['year'] <= 2000)
]

pivot_df = starwars_df.pivot(index='year', columns='name', values='Total')


chart = pivot_df.plot(
    figsize=(10, 6),
    title='Usage of Star Wars Names (1950–2000)',
    linewidth=2
)


chart.axvline(x=1977, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=1.5, label='Star Wars (1977)')
chart.axvline(x=1983, color='purple', linestyle='--', linewidth=1.5, label='Return of the Jedi (1983)')

chart.set_xlabel('Year')
chart.set_ylabel('Number of Babies with Name')
chart.legend()

print("It looks like the name Luke increase a lot right when star wars got big")

```
